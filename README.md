#### 2.	project guide: 
Prof. Dhatri Pandya

#### 3.	Qualification of project guide:
M.E.

#### 4.	Name of Company: 
Sarvajanik College of Engineering & Technology, Surat

#### 5.	Project Title: 
ObsiDroid, Advanced Vision-based AI Robot.

#### 6.	Project Objective/Aim: 
A robot which can perform autonomous navigation and can detect and localize objects in 3d space. Autonomously pickup and drop object using robotic arm. Performs tasks based on voice command and also it can be control via android remote control application. It has rocker bogie mechanism so that it can climb up and down stairs.    

#### 7.	Project Outcome: 
we have learned how to practically deploy the Machine Learning models about object detection. Creating and testing the algorithms in real world applications. Tried out different deep learning models for our application and getting better accuracy for object detection for different objects.

#### 8.	What we are doing in it: 
I created and trained the 3d object detection models of different objects. and got experience to work on OpenCV AI Kit as well as Jetson Nano. Also worked on Robot Operating System - that is used to manage different modules of the robot.

#### 9.	Your Learning: 
we gained experience in various Deep Learning techniques. We used Spatial AI for depth sensing, 3D object detection and localization. Also worked on OpenCV AI Kit which is a stereo depth camera and AI Processor. Learned communication between hardware and software of the robot.
